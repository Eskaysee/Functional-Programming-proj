Part A runs as specified in the assignment scope

for Part B simply type f "<a,b string>" in quotation marks
"_" represents the blanks

The sequence of possible Turing machine state configurations
that are used during the computation of f with the input string:
"aba" is ...
<Qs,'a','_',Q3>, <Q3,'b','b',Q3>, <Q3,'a','a',Q3>, <Q3,'_','_',Q4>, <Q4,'a','_',Q5>, <Q5,'b','b',Q5>, <Q5,'_','_',Qs>, <Qs,'b','_',Q1>, <Q1,'_','_',Q2>, <Q2,'_','_',Qa>

The turing machine compares the outer chars (first then last) of a string, while recursively moving inwards.
In the example, the pointer is at the first char 'a' then moves all the way to the right to get the last
char 'a' before moving to the middle to get char 'b'. takes a, then a, then takes b.
